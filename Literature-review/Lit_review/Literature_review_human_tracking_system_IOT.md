# Literature Survey on Human Tracking Systems Based on GPS and IoT

## Introduction

The increasing prevalence of crime and accidents has heightened the need for effective human tracking systems. These systems utilize Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide real-time location tracking, enhancing safety and security for individuals, particularly vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. This literature survey explores various studies and technologies related to human tracking systems, focusing on their methodologies, applications, challenges, and future directions.

## GPS Technology in Human Tracking

### Overview of GPS Technology

GPS technology has revolutionized navigation and location tracking since its inception. According to [1], GPS operates through a constellation of satellites that transmit signals to GPS receivers, allowing for precise location determination. The accuracy of GPS has improved significantly over the years, making it a reliable tool for various applications, including personal safety, navigation, and logistics.

### Applications of GPS in Tracking Systems

Numerous studies have highlighted the application of GPS in tracking systems. For instance, [2] discusses the implementation of GPS in child safety devices, emphasizing the importance of real-time tracking to prevent abductions. The study illustrates how GPS-enabled devices can alert parents or guardians if a child strays beyond a predefined boundary, thereby enhancing child safety in public spaces.

In another study, [3] examines the integration of GPS with mobile applications to improve personal safety. The research indicates that mobile apps equipped with GPS tracking can provide users with real-time updates on their location, enabling them to share their whereabouts with trusted contacts during emergencies. This capability is particularly beneficial for individuals in high-risk situations, such as those traveling alone or in unfamiliar areas.

### Case Studies on GPS Tracking

A notable case study by [4] focuses on the use of GPS tracking in the context of elderly care. The study presents a GPS-enabled wristband designed for elderly individuals with cognitive impairments. The device allows caregivers to monitor the location of their charges in real-time, providing peace of mind and ensuring timely assistance in case of emergencies. The findings suggest that such devices can significantly enhance the quality of care for elderly individuals, promoting independence while ensuring safety.

## Internet of Things (IoT) and Human Tracking

### The Role of IoT in Tracking Systems

The integration of IoT with GPS technology has further transformed human tracking systems. IoT refers to the interconnection of physical devices embedded with sensors and software that enable them to collect and exchange data. As noted by [5], IoT enhances the functionality of tracking systems by allowing for remote monitoring, data analysis, and automated responses to specific conditions.

### IoT-Enabled Tracking Systems

A study by [6] presents an IoT-based tracking system that utilizes GPS and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) technologies. The system is designed to track the location of elderly individuals, providing caregivers with real-time updates on their movements. The research demonstrates how IoT can facilitate better monitoring of vulnerable populations, ensuring their safety and well-being.

Another significant contribution is made by [7], which explores the use of IoT in smart cities. The study discusses how tracking systems can be employed to monitor the movement of citizens in public spaces, enhancing urban safety. By analyzing data collected from various IoT devices, city planners can identify patterns in crowd dynamics and potential hazards, leading to more informed decision-making and resource allocation.

### Real-World Implementations

Real-world implementations of IoT-enabled tracking systems have shown promising results. For example, [8] describes a pilot project in a metropolitan area where IoT devices were deployed to track the movement of children in schools. The system provided parents with real-time notifications if their child left the school premises, significantly reducing the risk of abduction and enhancing overall safety.

## Challenges and Considerations

Despite the advancements in human tracking systems, several challenges remain. Privacy concerns are a significant issue, as highlighted by [9]. The collection and transmission of location data raise ethical questions regarding user consent and data security. Researchers argue for the need to establish clear guidelines and regulations to protect individuals' privacy while utilizing tracking technologies.

### Technical Challenges

Furthermore, [10] discusses the technical challenges associated with GPS and IoT integration. Issues such as signal interference, battery life, and data transmission reliability can impact the effectiveness of tracking systems. The study suggests that ongoing research and development are necessary to address these challenges and improve system performance.

### Ethical and Social Implications

The ethical implications of human tracking systems are also a critical area of concern. According to [11], the potential for misuse of tracking data poses risks to individual privacy and autonomy. The study advocates for a balanced approach that considers both the benefits of tracking technologies and the rights of individuals to control their personal information.

## Future Directions

The future of human tracking systems appears promising, with ongoing advancements in technology. Emerging trends such as the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in tracking systems are gaining attention. According to [12], AI can enhance the accuracy of location predictions and enable predictive analytics for better decision-making in emergency situations.

### Miniaturization and Wearable Technology

Moreover, the miniaturization of tracking devices is a key area of focus. As noted by [13], smaller and more discreet devices can improve user acceptance and comfort, particularly for children and elderly individuals. The integration of additional features, such as health monitoring sensors, could further enhance the utility of tracking systems. For instance, wearable devices that monitor vital signs alongside location data could provide comprehensive health and safety solutions.

### Integration with Smart Home Systems

The integration of tracking systems with smart home technologies is another promising direction. A study by [14] explores how IoT-enabled tracking devices can communicate with smart home systems to provide alerts and automate responses in case of emergencies. For example, if a tracked individual falls or experiences a medical emergency, the system could automatically notify caregivers and emergency services, ensuring timely assistance.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the literature on human tracking systems highlights the significant role of GPS and IoT technologies in enhancing safety and security. While challenges such as privacy concerns and technical limitations exist, ongoing research and innovation continue to drive the development of more effective and user-friendly tracking solutions. The future of human tracking systems holds great potential, with advancements in AI, miniaturization, and additional functionalities paving the way for more comprehensive safety solutions.
